okay, so fastQC can be used in scripts.

per documentation at:
https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/

documentation at:
https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/Help/

installation specific documentation at:
https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/INSTALL.txt

downloaded zip folder and moved to bioinformatics directory.
decompressed it and then made the fastqc binary executable.
```
chmod 755 fastqc
```

okay cool. now lets see if we can feed it the illumina data from the clover run.

well first, lets plan out the script to load all of the reads. I may have to un-gzip all of the files.

so:
1. decompress all fastq files
2. copy directory structure into output folder for fastQC reports.
3. feed sample directory containing reads into fastQC
4. output report into corresponding directory in output
5. move onto next sample directory
6. ???
7. profit
