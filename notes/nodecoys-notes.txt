okay, so mapping percent is quite low.

nic recommended running index without decoys.

so that I shall do.

salmon index -t transcript.fa -i index_nodecoy -k 31

```

cool lets run quant now.

```
salmonMultiQuant.sh /Users/michaelfoster/sequencing/summer/clover_project/refseq/transcript-ref/attempt4noDecoys/index_nodecoy \
/Users/michaelfoster/sequencing/data-raw_seq/clover/RNAseq_Trifolium_repens_2021/MD5/trimmed/fastq \

```
just as dismal, maybe 1-2% increase.

maybe I need to remake the transcripts.fa file using gffread?

that didn't work.
