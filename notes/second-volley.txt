okay lets use bedtools to extract the transcript file from the gtf file.

using bedtools getfasta:
as documented at <https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/getfasta.html?highlight=get%20fasta>

example command:
```
$ getFasta [OPTIONS] -fi <input FASTA> -bed <BED/GFF/VCF> -fo transcripts.fa
```
lets try it. 

```
 bedtools getfasta -fi /Users/michaelfoster/sequencing/data-raw_seq/reference_Genomes/trifolium_repens/ncbi-genomes-2022-06-15/GCA_005869975.1_AgR_To_v5_genomic.fna -bed TrR.v5.renamed_reformated-1.gtf -fo transcript-attempt.fa 
```
it completed without any terminal output, did create transcript=attempt.fa
lets look at it.
```
❯ ls
TrR.v5.gtf2bam.bam              TrR.v5.renamed_reformated-1.gtf transcript-attempt.fa

okay lets hope that works well enough for salmon.

so.
lets do the next bit now that we have transcripts.fa for the salmon part.

following from https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/

first lets activate the rosetta x86 version of conda with the salmonx86 environment 
```
❯ rosettaenv
alright lets activate source to miniconda3 so this script works
now to activate base x86_64 env
should be in rosetta!

okay same error as before.

is it the gencode bit causing an error?
hmm..

okay, so lets start from the script included with salmontools.

Okay I'm not waiting 200 hours for a single thread to map this transcriptome. Lets go with ole trusty 32 threads.

```
generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh -j 32 -a TrR.v5.renamed_reformated-1.gtf -g /Users/michaelfoster/sequencing/data-raw_seq/reference_Genomes/trifolium_repens/ncbi-genomes-2022-06-15/GCA_005869975.1_AgR_To_v5_genomic.fna -t transcript-attempt.fa -o script-gentrome.fa
```

update: every single CPU is redlined at 100% it's pretty neat to see all 10 cores at 100% usage and mem at 80%.

YES!!!!!!!
40minutes 33s to run

also... didn't realize it was outputting as a directory so using .fa in -fo was useless. have since renamed it to plain ole gentrome.
lets look at the mess of a directory and then within the gentrome directory.

...also i moved all the stuff from the failed attempt into their own directory.
see below.
