okay lets use bedtools to extract the transcript file from the gtf file.

using bedtools getfasta:
as documented at <https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/getfasta.html?highlight=get%20fasta>

example command:
```
$ getFasta [OPTIONS] -fi <input FASTA> -bed <BED/GFF/VCF> -fo transcripts.fa
```
lets try it. 

```
 bedtools getfasta -fi /Users/michaelfoster/sequencing/data-raw_seq/reference_Genomes/trifolium_repens/ncbi-genomes-2022-06-15/GCA_005869975.1_AgR_To_v5_genomic.fna -bed TrR.v5.renamed_reformated-1.gtf -fo transcript-attempt.fa 
```
it completed without any terminal output, did create transcript=attempt.fa
lets look at it.
```
❯ ls
TrR.v5.gtf2bam.bam              TrR.v5.renamed_reformated-1.gtf transcript-attempt.fa

okay lets hope that works well enough for salmon.

so.
lets do the next bit now that we have transcripts.fa for the salmon part.

following from https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/

first lets activate the rosetta x86 version of conda with the salmonx86 environment 
```
❯ rosettaenv
alright lets activate source to miniconda3 so this script works
now to activate base x86_64 env
should be in rosetta!

okay same error as before.

is it the gencode bit causing an error?
hmm..

Okay I'm not waiting 200 hours for a single thread to map this transcriptome. Lets go with ole trusty 32 threads.

```
generateDecoyTranscriptome.sh -j 32 -a TrR.v5.renamed_reformated-1.gtf -g /Users/michaelfoster/sequencing/data-raw_seq/reference_Genomes/trifolium_repens/ncbi-genomes-2022-06-15/GCA_005869975.1_AgR_To_v5_genomic.fna -t transcript-attempt.fa -o script-gentrome.fa

update: every single CPU is redlined at 100% it's pretty neat to see all 10 cores at 100% usage and mem at 80%.

YES!!!!!!!
40minutes 33s to run

also... didn't realize it was outputting as a directory so using .fa in -fo was useless. have since renamed it to plain ole gentrome.
lets look at the mess of a directory and then within the gentrome directory.

...also i moved all the stuff from the failed attempt into their own directory.
see below.

okay, so now that the gentrome and index have been computed, lets try and use salmon quant on the sample reads.
should actually work now! 

as per <https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

using what was just generated above in bedtools-attempt/gentrome/

the example given in the documentation:
```
salmon index -t transcripts.fa -i transcripts_index --decoys decoys.txt -k 31
```

okay, so: per the documentation:
"This will build the mapping-based index, using an auxiliary k-mer hash over k-mers of length 31. While the mapping algorithms will make used of arbitrarily long matches between the query and reference, the k size selected here will act as the minimum acceptable length for a valid match. Thus, a smaller value of k may slightly improve sensitivty. We find that a k of 31 seems to work well for reads of 75bp or longer, but you might consider a smaller k if you plan to deal with shorter reads. Also, a shoter value of k may improve sensitivity even more when using selective alignment (enabled via the –validateMappings flag). So, if you are seeing a smaller mapping rate than you might expect, consider building the index with a slightly smaller k."

so we're generating a transcript index based on the index file, the decoys file, and the transcripts file with a kmer length of 31. 
this hasn't worked for the last two attempts, maybe running the script that took 40 minutes and gave no errors will actually work this time..

makes sense, lets try it now.

from within the directory specified above.
```
#command to run
salmon index -t gentrome.fa -i transcripts_index_1 --decoys decoys.txt -k 31

```

so no whitespace at all in either file, should I tell it to use ">" as the separator?
maybe I'm not grepping correctly?
Anyways, let me try to run the index command again but with > as the separator? idk. I thought it would work this time but the same error is still present. It appears to be some formatting issue.

# >:|

wait, the error is specified...
[2022-06-21 10:53:16.469] [puff::index::jointLog] [error] In FixFasta, two references with the same name but different sequences: CM019101.1:901500-907388

so the issue is with CM019101.1:901500-907388, I wonder what's in the decoys/gentrome.fa files.

```
❯ cat gentrome.fa| grep "CM019101.1901500-907388"
#NOTHING OUTPUT WHAT?
```
grepping CM019101.1 outputs a lot.
like

```
❯ cat gentrome.fa| grep "CM019101.1901500-907388"
❯ cat gentrome.fa| grep "CM019101.1901500-907388" | wc -l
       0
❯ cat gentrome.fa| grep "CM019101.1" | wc -l
   63873
```
like what?

```
❯ cat decoys.txt| grep "CM019101.1"
CM019101.1
❯ cat decoys.txt| grep "CM019101.1" | wc -l
       1
```
maybe it should be deleted from decoys??
idk...

```

okay lets check the github issues.
here's one from 30/March/2021
<https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/642>
apparently their issue was due to --gencode being used, I haven't used that. I tried it and it failed even faster!
so on review of the script that generated the index, it appears a kmer length of 16 was used. Lets try index again with -k 16...

nope still failed.
how about 15
same error.
okay, so the issue is with fix fasta...
found another error with fix fasta but the ending error is different.
<https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/572>
reading now...
okay so their error was caused because of formatting issues, no definitive solution prescribed and issue closed :(
***
wait, my error may be with how I'm generating the initial transcriptome file...
if the issue is with duplicates/duplicate names, there's probably something I'm not doing right in generating the transcriptome from the gtf and reference fasta.. will reattempt from that point.

***
here's the full decoys.txt

Why are the CM's not in order? actually none of the transcripts are in order, do I need to sort and arrange in numerical order?
I have no idea..

anyways, time to try the same thing from earlier I think..
I need to organize my notes.

"Please provide a reference FASTA file that includes all targets present in the BAM header If you have access to the genome FASTA and GTF used for alignment consider generating a transcriptome fasta using a command like: gffread -w output.fa -g genome.fa genome.gtf"
so lets attempt to run that and generate the transcriptome to then feed into the salmon script.

lets try again! 

gonna redownload the transcript gtf file as well since I'm not completely sure I didn't overwrite it early on while I was still learning these tools...

so downloading it from the email nic sent, then renaming it to TrR.v5.transcript.fresh.gtf.gz

okay, it's now in refseq and I also copied the ref genome just to make writing commands less prone to errors having to path it in from way out of the cwd.

so back to the command above..

gffread -w output.fa -g genome.fa genome.gtf
okay, so that'll be something like

```
gffread -w transcripts-notbroken.fa -g GCA_005.... actually lets rename the ref-genome so it isn't pure pain.
```
renaming it to trifoliumRefGenome.fna.gz or something like that..

okay, take II.

```
gffread -w transcripts_notbroken.fa -g trifoliumrepens_RefGenome_v5.fna.gz TrR.v5.transcript.fresh.gtf.gz
```
and I'll back it up just to be safe. 

so. for gffread, I think since the issue is with potential duplicates: I shall use the 
-M/--merge flag + -d dupetrans to throw out "redundant transcripts" and then write them to a file.
then 
maybe -t as it is listed as  -t    use <trackname> in the 2nd column of each GFF/GTF output line.
maybe that'll fix the duplicate names issue?
maybe both?
definitely run -v,-E to expose duplicate transcript IDs.

so first, 
gffread -E -g trifoliumrepens_RefGenome_v5.fna.gz  TrR.v5.transcript.fresh.gtf.gz
which should tell me all of the duplicates, 
using -d should spit em out into a file i'll call sequence dupes.
lets try it.
...

but first, lets just make it spit out all of the "suspicious mRNAs" using -E 

```
❯ gffread -g trifoliumrepens_RefGenome_v5.fna.gz -E TrR.v5.transcript.fresh.gtf.gz
Command line was:
gffread -g trifoliumrepens_RefGenome_v5.fna.gz -E TrR.v5.transcript.fresh.gtf.gz
Error: sequence lines in a FASTA record must have the same length!
```
wonderful, a new error! 

looking at the ref genome:
grepped the ">" and got a large file with this many chromosome mappings and the rest as scaffolds.
```

okay, on review of the genbank file, all chromosomes and the chloroplast plasmid are present plus those 10,000 scaffolds
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/?term=txid3899[orgn]>

~2.9% of the sequences are unmapped. Would it be correct to just yeet those out?

actually, nah, the issue isn't even with those scaffolds, its with literally the first chromosome. 
it hasn't even made it to the second chromosome yet, or any of the scaffolds. 
maybe I should attempt to run it and yeet the duplicates?

lets gunzip it and look at it.

```
❯ gunzip -9dkvl trifoliumrepens_RefGenome_v5.fna.gz
method  crc     date  time    compressed uncompressed  ratio uncompressed_name
defla 948bedd1 Jun 21 11:28    243603716    932487804  73.8% trifoliumrepens_RefGenome_v5.fna

```
okay now to actually decompress the files and get a bedtools summary..

```
❯ bedtools summary -i TrR.v5.transcript.fresh.gtf -g trifoliumrepens_RefGenome_v5.fna
Error: The genome file trifoliumrepens_RefGenome_v5.fna has no valid entries (are you sure it's a 2-column bedtools genome file). Exiting.
```
okay it isn't a bedtools genome file so no surprise there.
maybe samtools stats?

```
❯ samtools stats trifoliumrepens_RefGenome_v5.fna
[1]    15562 bus error  samtools stats trifoliumrepens_RefGenome_v5.fna
```
nice.

then it appears to be spitting out the gff file verbose.
hm
idk if I want to try this again but hey, lets use the stuff specified above and spit out the different components as well as a transcript file.
lets also mark dupes and merge them.

maybe related:

okay, using advice from <https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/740>
"You do not need a different transcriptome for each readset. Your general workflow should be...

prepare a transcriptome in fasta format
For each sample, align that sample to the transcriptome to create a bam file using hisat2 and samtools
For each bam file, run salmon quant using that bam file and the transcriptome as input
merge output using salmon quantmerge
...I'm curious why you are using hisat2 though. Every benchmark I've seen suggests that just using salmons psuedo-mapper works just as well."

okay so sample needs to align against transcriptome and output a bam file using hisat2 and samtools,
then run salmon quant using that bam file and the transcriptome as input.
merge output via quantmerge?
I dunno. sounds like it might work.. No clue.. will have to see if I can get salmon index to work since thats the first issue altogether.....

okay, so the error with first-volley is similar to this one 
<https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon/issues/644>

possibly could be this:
"Hey,

So I solved the issue over the weekend. My error was caused by my decoy file having my chromosome names with > in front of them meaning it couldn't find them when creating the index.
`
Instead of for example

grep "^>" <(zcat GRCm38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz) | cut -d " " -f 1 > decoys.txt

sed -i -e 's/>//g' decoys.txt'

I used the following instead.

grep "^>" <(gunzip -c GRCm38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz) | cut -d " " -f 1 > decoys.txt

sed -i.bak -e 's/>//g' decoys.txt

`
I'm guessing this isn't your issue but just in case it helps! I would check your "gentrome" file and look if the decoy and names within your gentrome file match up properly. That's how I realized the > was disrupting my analysis!

Hope this helps.

Best Regards,
Adrian
"

#### OKAY, so I went into bedtools attempt and then ran the sed command on both the decoys and gentrome files. once the script in attempt 3 finishes that is... I probably broke the fasta by pulling the fasta header.
